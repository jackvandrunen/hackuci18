The broccoli-mushroom-chicken-wich is straight mcnastay. 

I kinda thought this might be the case going into it (but they swore that it was the best 1) - hence, I requested a lite smattering of the garlic cremen sauce. Came back smothered in cremen. eeew. Had to jettison the sandwich from my vehicle a short time later...which was the only fun thing I did today and the reason for the 5 stars.
--------------------
Came at 7:10pm on a Saturday, there weren't many people but that might also be b/c it's the Saturday before classes at uci start again.  Used the buy one 9" combo and get a second 9" 50% off deal to grab 4 sandwiches for the five of us. B/c we had to use cash for the deal, the sofas were also upgraded to large sizes.  I got the chicken bacon mushroom with garlic sauce!  Lovely and toasty bread, piping hot cheese, and the broccoli was tender.  My sister's absolute favorite for the past six years, she adores their garlic sauce and was so happy when they offered her some extra is sauce cups. The one thing that kinda got to me was the slightly dry chicken.  It's the biggest thing besides undercooked chicken that I hate.  B/c it was only slightly dry (and not to the point of sucking all the moisture out of my mouth like at the dentist) and the sauce and cheese helped out, it kinda lessened the blow.  If you like white pasta and garlic bread, this is probably the sandwich for you.  
Kinda sad that all of the croissants except for the butter ones were all gone, especially since they were advertised as "any croissant $1", but we came pretty close to their closing hour.

Food 3.5/5
Service 5/5!
--------------------
I really like the Chicken Dijon sandwich here. Great flavors. 

I also tried the Chicken Cordonbleu. Pretty good, but flavors were a bit bland for me. 

Overall, great sandwich place. Friendly and efficient service.
--------------------
"Triangular sandwiches taste better than square ones."  --Peter Kay

The hubs and I were up and about the area pretty early and needed a bite for breakfast.  We gave Le Diplomat a try over Peet's Coffee.  I'm a fan of La Vie en France bakery products and I noticed their signage indicating that they serve their products.  I decided on a Chicken Cordon Bleu Croissant and the hubs went with a Chicken Dijon sandwich.  

My croissant was alright.  The croissant itself was lovely, and had a standard slice of ham, some chunk chicken, and a slice of Swiss cheese melted between them.  

The hub's chicken dijon was good, but the sauce was rather salty and too rich. The butter was dripping out of the sandwich with every bite.  Don't get me wrong, we all love butter - but even this would make Paula Deen raise an eyebrow!
--------------------
Finally had a chance to come here. I was told the sandwich to get was the chicken mushroom broccoli so that's what I ordered. 

The sandwich was pretty tasty. It was creamy and served hot. I chose to add the garlic sauce which was pretty tasty as well. 

Not sure how the other sandwiches hold up to the reviews but I'll definitely come back to try some more.
--------------------
I ALWAYS make a pit stop here whenever I'm in OC. 

I was first introduce to this little cafe one night when I was visiting my friend at UCI my freshman year of college and it CHANGED MY LIFE! 

My friend and I would sometimes drive from UCR to UCI just to eat here (and visit my friends too I guess, mostly for the sandwich). 

*CHICKEN CORDON-BLEU w/extra GARLIC SAUCE! I've tried their other sandwiches, and this one tops it all. 

PS: Don't forget to get their Sriracha Sauce! Sooo good with their sandwiches.
--------------------
Finally had the chance to check this place out and it was everything I had hoped for! It's a pretty simple looking shop with counter service, which is perfectly fine since there's so many great seating options outside. Anyways, you know I had to check out their...

Chicken Mushroom Broccoli Sandwich - so delicious and messy to eat! Definitely grab your napkins for this one and don't forget to add some sriracha on there for that extra kick! The garlic sauce was soo yummy and all the ingredients paired perfectly. If I had gone to school here it would've definitely been a regular lunch spot for me. 

Overall, it's an affordable, quick, and delicious lunch spot. After you finish eating, you can walk it off through the Trader Joe's, Target, and other stores located in the plaza.
--------------------
Le Dip: one of UCI and the Irvine community's favorite places!

Chicken broccoli mushroom with that famed garlic sauce is a winner. I've also had a couple of their vegetarian options... Any of their sandwich creations on that famed French baguette is DELICIOUS.

People drool over their sandwiches. I save it for whenever I want to treat myself.

Their drink options and smoothies are a nice addition as well. Chill day by UCI, this place never disappoints. In a plaza where big chain restaurants and starting to take over, it's no wonder our little Le Dip has survived. Their sandwiches are unbeatable.
--------------------
Very tasty sandwiches at a decent price. I especially like the chicken, broccoli, mushroom sandwich. Friendly and welcoming staff. Fast service. You must try it!
--------------------
Simple food. Simple price. DELICIOUS SANDWICHES!! 

Le dip is a go to place when you're hungry and on a budget. Always make sure to get extra garlic spread because it is one of a kind! Thank you Le Dip for feeding us hungry college students!
--------------------
Really really simple place, really really simple food, but really really good!

With a juicy 4.5 star average from over 1600 reviews to date, Le Dip seemed almost underwhelming at first glance - the shop was really small and didn't look too fancy or new, and the sandwiches everyone was raving about looked flat, sloppy, and...lacking.

But after giving the place a few tries, I began to understand why UCI students loved this place religiously.. It's fast, cheap, and just downright delicious. 

The staff are super friendly and the quality of the food is consistently good. Every visit here has just been an absolute pleasure. 

A thorough review doesn't go without mentioning some negatives, so here they are - First of all, I personally stay away from the Vietnamese sandwiches because they're relatively plain and certainly not up to par with the authentic ones you get from local viet restaurants.. Stick with the classics, my favorites being the chicken broccoli mushroom and the bacon chicken club :)

   Second, Le Dip kind of brands itself as a bakery/cafe. That being said, I would love to see them start taking their coffee game to the next level, because they've told me that things like their Vietnamese iced coffee are all pre-made, and as much as I love ordering it, it always comes out overly sweet.

All that being said, Le Dip has definitely been one of my college staples during my time at UCI, and will forever hold a special place in my heart :')
--------------------
Still the best place to go for sandwiches in Irvine hands down. ALL their sandwiches are delicious, but my go to back in the days was the chicken garlic, it's hot, bread grilled nicely, good amount of chicken, garlic sauce was amazing, and all of it went together great after dumping sriracha to add some spiciness to it. 

Staff was always nice and helpful. Food is prepared quick. There's plenty of parking in the lot, if you live in irvine or go to school at uci across the street, best place to go anytime of the day! I am so happy this place is still around considering the UTC has changed quite a bit.

Swore i wrote a review of this place a long time ago, guess not, just go here!
--------------------
Delicious sandwiches and not pretentious little place.  Love it! 

The pricing is amazing but this is because of the cafe's proximity to a university.  

This place feeds starving students as well as young professionals who want to stop in and grab a well-made sandwich.
--------------------
Back in the UCI days, this was the place to be!  The best thing- the chicken, mushroom, and broccoli sandwich.  Yes!  Nice, little plaza at UTC, which has looked nicer over the decades.
--------------------
I haven't been here in awhile and the chicken brocolli mushroom sandwich with extra garlic sauce is just as I remembered.  Did the price drop?  It's only $6.75 for a large sandwich.  People here are super nice, will be back again and again!
--------------------
Small unassuming shop in the middle of the university towncenter.  Sandwhiches are excellent, and reasonably priced.  The bread is awesome and the service was great.  Definitely one of the better values in this plaza.
--------------------
This place never disappoint. Is always good and delicious. I am always here if I am around the area. What are you waiting for? Just go and have a good sandwich
--------------------
When you visit UCI's University Village Center on a Sunday morning and realize everything doesn't open until 11AM, but you're starving at 10AM, this is the place to go.

The staff is helpful and they always recommend their most popular items. My boyfriend and I went with the full 9" Garlic Chicken Sandwich which is cut in half for easier handling. The bread is crispy and warm and the garlic sauce is creamy. Along with chicken, there were chunks of mushroom and broccoli stuffed in there.

This kind of sandwich reminds me of something my mom or grandma would make. It's filling and warms my soul. Even only eating half a sandwich, I was content. I wouldn't mind coming back again for more.
--------------------
Mmmm I love Le Dip for a cheap but satisfying meal as a college student. All of their sandwiches are so good. My favorite has to be the chicken bacon club. 

It's serving piping hot, and cut in half so you can share with a friend. Their baguette is nice and crispy, filled with chicken, bacon cheese and tomato, it's delicious. Get it with the garlic sauce! It's to die for! The combination is good for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 

It's hard to beat a place like Le Dip. It'll always be my go-to at UTC.
--------------------
I don't know why this place is rated so highly. They took a really long time to make my food and the french connection was just bread with meat and cheese. It didn't taste good and I don't recommend this place to anyone.
--------------------
====================
in-n-out-burger-irvine
====================
--------------------
In-N-Out has been one of my favorite burger spots for years. Whenever I'm in California, it's always my first stop.

They are always busy no matter what time of day, but their service is always outstanding. I never have to wait long for my food and the workers are always friendly. 

As far as value is concerned, it's tough to beat In-N-Out. They have cheap burgers, fries, and shakes and they do all of them very well. My personal vice is the Animal fries. They cover their regular fries with a cheese and grilled onion spread that invites you to make a mess as you tear into it. 

Another trip to California - another great experience at In-N-Out!
--------------------
So finding hair in food pretty much seems to be a normal thing these days right? Well, not today buddy because while midway enjoying our double cheeseburger, we unexpectedly found a RECEIPT inside. I mean I guess that's cool if you're into the whole finding the golden ticket thing? I guess we won a remake of the double cheeseburger in exchange for a half eaten one and a receipt. 


The employees were as surprised as we were and they were nice enough to make us another.
--------------------
This is the In N Out i used to eat at about...4 times a week because I lived across the street.  I weighed 330lbs at the time, my knees hurt, but oh lord, was I happy.

I've since lost over 100lbs, my knees are fine, and I can run like the dickens, but no matter how far or how fast I run, I will never catch up to the level of happiness I had back then...

*wind blows as a wolf howls in the distance*
--------------------
First time in-n-out burger. I ordered the animal style burger which was excellent however the fries tasted too dry. The milkshake was excellent and not too sweet. We were haggled by homeless people inside the restaurant but the staff escorted them outside. There were people outside the restaurant asking for money as well. 
Animal style burger had pickles sautéed onions and special sauce.
--------------------
Typical In-N-Out location. Pay attention to where you park, because the line for drive through during peak hours can actually block the second row of parking spots and you will find yourself stuck in the parking lot, forced to ask drivers in line to make some space for you to reverse (true story bro).

Besides the parking lot situation during peak hours, the staff is usually very friendly, although they are so many that I cannot evaluate but the average experience I had.

The food is typical In-N-Out. Solid flavor and with great signature items. Make sure to order grilled onions and ask for extra spread to make your animal-style fries even more delicious.
I'm a big fan of In-N-Out, but with that taste and very low prices, it's just too hard to say no to come here for lunch!
--------------------
It's a no brainer. I frequented this place when I was a UCI student and I still come here as I've worked in the area. 

My usual are well-done fries (since I think they're default fries are too soggy) and a Hamburger with whole grilled onions, extra toasted bun, chopped chilies, and no salt. YUM.

When I'm feeling really gluttonous, I'll add in a Neapolitan shake. ;)
--------------------
Can't go wrong. Lived in socal for the majority of my life and have been to in-n-out since the burgers were less than $3. Even with inflation, the quality is still great, the menu still simple, and the staff super nice and friendly. Good food and good service goes a long way, and I always come back for the double double with pickles, grilled onions and chopped chilis and an order of their fresh fries (animal-style when I'm feeling extra special :P).
--------------------
The one and only. Exceptional service. Fantastic Fries. A great value. Can I work here on the weekends? Do employees get free French fries?

Yeah, I know. I'll hop on bing.com and obtain the answer. Or maybe I can just continue being a customer. That's my jam for now.
--------------------
My son order from here while we are here on vacation and he loved it. He brought me one, but he ate mine! Lol 
We do not have one back home.
--------------------
This location specifically gave me soggy, limp, sad fries last time I came here. So last night I ask the person taking my order if she would make sure they aren't soggy this time. 
What I ended up with were carbonized French fries that were super greasy (like fried a second time). They were hard, like they had no more moister in them, just saturated with grease. Everything else was spot on. But two times in a row I get disgusting fries. Huge bummer to give someone money for nasty fries. :(
--------------------
Let me say it here and now, I've never had an In-n-Out disappoint and this was no exception. This fast food chain is the face of the American burger. They make it fresh and fast. Definitely a must at any In-N-Out are the animal fries. Since this is greasy food, I recommend a soft drink with your meal. It does get pretty hectic here, but only because there is a college campus right next to it. Even though it is hectic, it doesn't mean that they are lacking in the taste and quality. You still get your same amazing burger you know and love.
--------------------
The quality and taste of an In-N-Out burger never varies by location which clearly makes it one of the better quick and tasty burger joint. Extremely great location near UCI for all the broke college kids out there. Can't complain if its cheap and delicious! 

I always stick to the protein style cheeseburger with extra grilled onions and chopped chili. Quite a deal for $2.60 and add in fries of course for an additional $1.75. 

Expect to wait if you come during prime time. We got here a little after 6 and just made it before the crowd - by 630, the lines were almost at the door on a Thursday evening.
--------------------
Tried the hot cocoa today it was sad. Tasted like watered down powder and marsh mellows
--------------------
I love this location. They are very fast and friendly. The drive-thru is always backed up so be careful where you park. I usually get double single protein style with grilled onions and it was come out delicious. If you are ordering fries, you can ask for extra spread at no charge at all. I am a big fan of their animal style fries! Only  if I didn't have to watch what I eat, I would eat In-N-Out everyday.
--------------------
This in n out has good service but their fries are so dang oily!
I ordered animal fries which were delicious but as the topping layer disappeared, there were only oily, double fried fries...i ordered regular style so i was v sad

I love in n out fries and was super disappointed to see/taste this
Overall: if you want in n out fries that are super greasy and crispy, this is your place

Update: YIKES!!
Went back last night and there was an ant on a piece of my lettuce burger? They also forgot my grilled onions which really MAKE the burger.. pretty disappointed but i wasn't about to ask them to remake it because i had already ate some.
--------------------
We love the cheese burger and fries! Still the best burger joint in OC/LA.
You can't go wrong for the whole family. Served hot! Unlike the other fast food joints!
--------------------
This In N Out is very efficient and clean for being busy since it is at UCIrvine and serves this entire area. 

In N Out! Simply the best, more healthy choice, and most consistent burger for on the go ppl. 

How anyone can rate In N Out anything less than 5-Stars?
--------------------
It's a California staple, and if you are visiting from out of state- you gotta see what the fuss is about!

(A note for our-of-towners, there is a secret menu that you can use to alter your orders. I always get my fries "animal style" with cheese, grilled onions and the special In N Out sauce)

All that being said, a fast food burger is a fast food burger. Although this one is better than most, it is by no means a foodie paradise.

This particular location is on UCI college campus, so it is most definitely louder and more raucous than most. Tables were dirty, food came out lukewarm (my burger was a little undercooked and pink which is always disconcerting in the fast food realm), and it was nothing to write home about.

On the plus side, food arrived quickly compared to other In N Out locations and the workers were extremely friendly and nice. 

Good for late night and people who have never been. Not great. Not horrible. That sad point in between.
--------------------
Don't think there's anything I can add that hasn't been said, but after going here for years, this is THE go-to place for a great burger by UC Irvine.  It is always packed, even during summer break.  BTW, if you pick up one of In-N-Out's T-shirts (which is an awesome shirt for $10!) and wear it outside of California, you will almost be guaranteed to be stopped by someone who will say how awesome In-N-Out is and how much they miss it!
--------------------
This is the Student In and Out Burger.
It's across the street from UC Irvine.
But anyone is welcome to dine here--no student ID required.

It's located in a really great area with other restaurants and stores.

Trader Joes is around the corner, so is Chipole, so if everyone is not in the mood for a burger, you can split up.

In and out has an outdoor seating area overlooking the parking lot.

Food quality was consistent with other stores.

Service was good.

blaze-fast-fired-pizza-irvine-3
====================
--------------------
I really can't tell the difference between all of these build-your-own pizza places. I guess the only things that set them apart are the prices and the toppings they offer; when it comes to both, Blaze doesn't disappoint. Each pizza is $8.65 and you can find all of the usual pizza ingredients (sausage, pepperoni, bacon, chicken, peppers, jalapenos, mushrooms, the list goes on and on). They do a thin crust pizza so it's ready in minutes. Service is fast and pleasant. However, this location does get busy since it's at the University Center (across from UCI), next to Target and Chipotle.

Overall, it's good stuff. Definitely shareable, but also definitely finishable if you're really hungry!
--------------------
Blaze is a pizza chain that'll let you build your own thin crust pizza! I built a bbq chicken pizza but there's no chicken, and it's only bbq drizzle. The pizza was so hard it tasted like cardboard. I'm not sure what happened today, but I wasn't satisfied. 

The lady who made the pizza was very rude too. She didn't put all the ingredients that I wanted on the pizza. Overall, I don't think I'll be coming back to this specific location.
--------------------
Just your basic make and bake pizza joint! 
You can build your own pizza or choose menu options (: 

One thing I especially like about Blaze is: 
Their pesto! I'm sure other places have this option but I've just recently started to get it and I really love it (: 

Also, their drinks are really refreshing and tasty! 

The service here is congenial, but nothing over the top special. 

My only gripe about this place is that they need to get a whole wheat dough option. I really feel I'd give it 5 stars if they did! I know other places have whole wheat dough, and I just wish Blaze could step it up and add it to their menu!  

TBH, I eat here out of convenience /: but it's still good!
--------------------
Sure it's always busy, but blaze is pretty good. Now that I've been going so often, and compare it to pieology or other thin crust pizza places... blaze provides so many options and it's just something you have to try.
--------------------
Vegans: which #pizza chain have you found to be most accommodating? Blaze would be mine. #Vegetarians & #vegan types might order their pizza  w/daiya cheese, kalamata olives, pepperoncini, roasted garlic & jalapeños
--------------------
I'm from NorCal, so we have Pieology, as opppsed to blaze (I don't know if blaze has since opened up restaurants in NorCal though). Similar DIY concept, really fast service, and kind staff. It's a bummer when they sometimes over-char my pizza and I have to pick off the burnt parts of the crust, but oh well. Really quick and easy delicious pizza!
--------------------
Burnt pizza. Blaze Fast-Burnt Pizza. 

I usually visit a restaurant a few times before I write a review and with good reason - the first time I came here, my pizza was amazing - the right amount of toppings, the right variety, and the thing wasn't burnt. 

I've since gone back a few times since this summer and this most recent visit - early Saturday morning a little after they opened - my pizza was burnt. It was disgusting and hard to eat. There was already a line forming cuz the guy in front of me was ordering ten pizzas and held everyone else up, so I didn't ask for a remake, but seriously - how do you burn a pizza? That  alone seriously killed the experience for me. I had to wait until I got back home to microwave the thing, in an effort to soften up the crust. 

Another thing they could've done better is handle the line more efficiently. The ten-pizza order dude in front of me had one employee working his pizzas - and no one else to help the rest of the line. Rather than hold up the rest of the line, another employee should step it  up and start working on our pizzas. It wasn't until 10 minutes later that someone started working on my pizza. 

While Blaze has several "creations" - their most popular option is their "Build Your Own". You can pick any toppings, from a large variety - different sauces and drizzles - all for $8.45 

For drinks, they have a traditional soda fountain, but also several "agua frescas" options like lemonade, blood orange lemonade, cilantro limeade, among others. 

Seating space is ample throughout the restaurant, although there are also dining spaces available outside as well. 

There are occasional offers through their app - you get one flame for every pizza you purchase, and ten flames equals a free pizza - but they also send you free drink coupons here and there. 

Overall, given my experiences here - it's a hit or miss - one visit you get a perfect pizza, the next visit, your pizza could be burnt.

On another note, I had reached out to the management at this location for a potential fundraising event, Brittany from their team reached out to me and never responded after I asked a few questions. Makes me wonder if that has anything to do with employee efficiency and the relative occurrence of the occasionally burnt pizza. 

There are more quality-consistent choices in the shopping center.
--------------------
Good make your own pizza place. The crust was thin and perfect. I went with the garlic pesto and spicy red sauce topped with meats, veggies, crushed garlic and roasted garlic. Yup, I went all garlic since not many places have roasted garlic as a topping. Loved the pizza and devoured the whole pie. Can't go wrong with making your own pizza!
--------------------
Blaze is a perfect place to grab some decent pizza with affordable price. I am usually here once a week getting BYO pizza. They are very generous with their portions and you can put whatever you like. All the ingredients looks/tastes fresh. The crust is also thin which makes it even more delicious. Since it is located in UTC the line does get long during lunch/dinner times. However,the service is pretty fast and everyone is friendly.
--------------------
I was introduced to Blaze by a vegan friend of mine. I was looking for some healthy and delicious pizza, and Blaze is definitely it! 

I usually get a build-your-own with classic red sauce, vegan cheese, and a punch of vegetables depending on my craving is the day. I really love that they offer to change their gloves for vegans/vegetarians. What I love most is the variety of options, the generous amount of toppings, and how fast the pizzas are baked. 

I visit this place with my boyfriend at least once a week. We really just can't enough of it. It's becoming a weekly tradition to go on a pizza date here. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for some tasty and healthy pizzas!!
--------------------
First time trying blaze pizza and wow was it good. I got a veggie pizza with extra spicy sauce. Pizza came out quick. The pizza has about 6 slices and it's good enough to share between 2 people. I definitely want to try one with meat next time.
--------------------
This place is so good. The bread is so fluffy and flaky, the tomato sauce is very creamy, and the toppings taste very fresh. Compared to Pieology, my experience is a lot better here, but I must say that they aren't as generous with the toppings. This is because they don't do the unlimited toppings like how Pieology does. This isn't like your normal to-go pizza place like Pizza Hut and Dominos. It falls in the same group as Pieology and Project Pie. So far in this category, it is definitely the best in its class. Only complaint... line is too long, but thry can't fix that. It's just too good.
--------------------
Who ever created this idea was a GENIUS. This blaze is consistently solid in delivering what I want at a fast paced. The prices are pretty affordable especially with the unlimited toppings($9)-though don't get too crazy because your pizza might not cook right with too many toppings.

I love the idea of the different cheeses as well as being able to mix n match the sauces at the beginning AND the end.

I love to top my pizza off with BBQ sauce or pesto at the end.

Service here is always friendly, and the value is always within a college students budget!
--------------------
The pizza is fast and the quality is usually very consistent. Expect there to be long lines at peak mealtime hours.. The lines often scare me away, but when people are scarce and I'm in the mood for pizza, I'll always be down for Blaze!

I really like the level of customization you get with your pizza from quality ingredients, all at an impressively low price. You see everything that goes into making your pizza, so you know exactly what you get and how much of it! No more getting mad at Domino's for skimping out on the toppings, haha.

Workers are friendly, there's a good amount of seating, and the facility is clean. Not to mention that compared to other Blaze locations that I've eaten at, this seems to be the best in terms of food and service.
--------------------
BUILD YOUR OWN PIZZA ...... Y E S ! ! !
It's taken me about 7-8 times building my own pizza to FINALLY get the one I like.

Great pizza for $8.25 (rounded to $9 including tax).  If you haven't been to a Blaze, you must go if you are a pizza lover.  For those of you who HAVE gone, you know what I mean ...... IT'S ADDICTING. Good for lunch, dinner, or supper.  They normally close at 9pm so no late night.

5 Star ....... Consistently the same everytime.  I LOVE this place.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
--------------------
This spot is my favorite pizza place but their phone ordering is flipping a coin. So they confirm the pick up time for online order and phone order but good luck picking it up on time. Though the quality is always good, the order processing always through me off and because of that I give it 2 stars and I hope they really fix it.
--------------------
Who doesn't like to blaze it up ??? Personally, I've had moments where I feel whatever about blaze and then I fall in love with it again. I love the concept of the personal pizza and I think blaze def offers a bang for your buck. 

Food- build your own pizza is the way the go. Maximize your output by stacking a lot of meat and toppings. I always cringe when I see people order the "build your own" and get two toppings. That's like going to the strip club and not getting a lap dance, what's the point ?

Service- it's ok, they are pretty damn slow at times. God forbid you go on a club fundraiser day because you will end up waiting an hour. Let's not even talk about PIE day 
 
Environment- located in UTC near campus it's pretty lively. Plenty of outdoor and indoor seating to enjoy your pizza.  Parking can be a pain in the ass. 

 Overall, blaze is a solid choice in UTC. I get tired of it easily but I fall in love again once I haven't had it in a while. Stay blazin my friends.
--------------------
I was very into Blaze for a few years. My adoration has tailed off a little recently. It's not really for any fault of Blaze, it's just hasn't really changed up its menu or anything. 

Blaze is a nice place to grab lunch. It is a little pricey, but the ingredients are high quality and you can get as many toppings as you want if you build your own. This particular front can get very busy especially around dinner. There is often a line out the door, and the line doesn't move very quickly for a build your own venue. 

I like splitting my pizza in two and getting half and half. The specialty drinks are good. The service is fine. Make sure to add arugula and pesto to your pizza after it's been fired if you're so inclined.
--------------------
I like thin crusted, make-it-yourself pizza. Blaze has plenty of toppings and it's perfectly cooked. It was a busy Friday night but it didn't take more than fifteen minutes to get my pizza. The salads are excellent! I ordered the kale salad. If you're looking for a #Thinsulin approved green light  dish, you can order the "pizza" salad. Just be careful with the salad since it contains red light foods that may spike your insulin.
--------------------
SECOND REVIEW:

I ordered a cheese pizza and it was fantastic!  

The crust was thin and toasted to perfection, the red tomato sauce was delicious, and the freshly-grated mozzarella cheese was abundant and yummy!  5 stars for the cheese pizza.

The counter staff was outstanding, courteous, efficient and hard-working.  5 stars to all of them.

[It was crowded at noontime.  Be prepared to wait in line.]
--------------------
====================
peets-coffee-irvine-2
====================
--------------------
This is a Peet's Coffee in University Center.

There was a clearly designated line for where to line up at, but since we came during a low traffic time, we didn't have to wait.

The staff was nice and the drinks we ordered tasted good, but rather sweet in my opinion. My tourist friend was fine with it.

A PokéStop was touchable from inside while waiting for the drinks.
--------------------
Update (since my review two weeks ago): 

Came in here to take advantage of a free welcome beverage I was offered as part of the Peet's Rewards app promotion. 

Restroom situation still sucks - but at this point, there's not much the business can do about it, since it appears to be the way the shopping center was planned. 

Internet is still spotty, but connection to the Retail Center's network is strong, just not sure why the coffeehouse can't provide stable service for their patrons. 

So what caused the change from one star to three stars? 

The baristas here. It was my second visit here, and first time dealing with Daisy. Not only was she patient and friendly (I was being indecisive regarding which drink to use my welcome reward on, as well as whether or not to warm up my pumpkin chocolate bread), but she also patiently waited for me to reload my app in order to "check in" for the Peet's Rewards program. In addition, during my stay, I overheard her asking each of the other customers whether they had the Rewards app or not - which only serves to reward repeat patrons, and by taking the time to ask each customer, it helps show her interest in seeing them return. 

Things are looking up, and while this may not be the best place to study (due to their lack of restrooms/crappy wifi), I could see it being a great place to grab a drink, meet up with some friends and catch up.
--------------------
I found myself in need of a place to sit at 6:00 and this was the only place open. It's a nice place to hang out and begin your day. I was by far not the first person to arrive. My normal drink is a Mocha, I saw that they had a "Javiva" --cold brew-- mocha and thought I would give it a try. It is very sweet, possibly a little too sweet for me. But what was I expecting from a Mocha? Service was good, possibly a little slow, but they only have two people working this early in the morning. They apologized for making me wait, though honestly, I didn't really think anything of the wait. It was barely a wait. 

Music is nice. Plenty of outlets. A good atmosphere to get some work done early in the morning.
--------------------
We were in town visiting old friends, so we came here to chat over coffee. I suggested Peet's, and fortunately there was one in the University Center.
This location is right by the parking lot of this plaza, with plenty of spots to choose from.
The coffee shop, much like the surrounding environment, is clean and safe. The staff here is pretty nice. They made our drinks well.
This locations does not have a restroom inside, which is ok because there are plenty throughout the plaza. 
It is a great place to bunker down and study inside, or to chat with friends over coffee on their outside seating.
--------------------
I am a fan of Starbucks coffees , but I liked the smell and taste if this coffee a lot. I ordered non fat vanilla latte. The large size is not that large compared to Venti in Starbucks. The only negative this is that I asked if they have a  healthy breakfast( something with egg whites etc.) and they did not have it. So I only had my coffee.
--------------------
Never been inside a Peet's before, I was unsure about what to get, so unsure that I practically asked the cashier to order for me. She stated that the most popular drink was the Iced Caramel macchiato ($4.20 for a small) and so I went with that. In a moment's notice the drink came out. It tasted like a standard coffee, nothing too special and it could have definitely used a stronger dose of caramel.

I would imagine this place to be a nice study area as all the tables were occupied by students even past 8PM. It's cute and comfortable, but I'm not too sure how the wifi is. I'll keep this place in mind when I'm sick of the library.
--------------------
I love coming to Peet's to study. It's a nice environment that I prefer to Starbucks. The drinks are also better and more interesting. 

I really like their black tea tie. It's black tea with creamer and condensed milk on the bottom. Definitely get a stick and mix it a little to get the sweetness from the condensed milk on the bottom, otherwise it's pretty tasteless from the ice on top. It's a beautiful drink to look at when the creamer is floating on top. If you don't like it too sweet, don't mix the condensed milk in all the way or it will just be very sweet milk tea.
--------------------
Life is too short to drink inferior coffee. Although this shop gets busy with the student traffic, and parking can be challenging during peak hours, it's worth the stop. Good flavor. Great service. Great staff who are upbeat and personable.

You will find this perfect place inside the University Town Center next to Trader Joe's. Slip in to take a quick break from your day.  Or maybe to get your day started.

There is some seating inside and more tables outside in the shared surrounding courtyard.
--------------------
First visit to Peet's coffee and it was actually pretty good. I usually go to Starbucks due to convenience, since there's 3 on campus and 2 off. 

I got a small Black Tie, and it's pretty good. I like the flavor of cold brew mixed with condensed milk. I didn't want to risk getting a larger size, since it's my first time coming here. After drinking all of it prettt quickly, I did end up regretting not getting a medium or large.

Ordering process was fast, since I checked in and paid through the app. My coffee was prepared really quickly too, a lot faster than any of the nearby Starbucks.

This the perfect place for college students to get their coffee fix. I think I'll be coming here more often instead of Starbucks.
--------------------
LOVE this location which is opened late!  Lots of FREE parking and they have the coconut whipped cream which is so decadent. Our go to drinks these days are the almond milk hot chocolate with coconut whip and the almond milk matcha latte with light coconut whip...this is like dessert for us...yum!!!

We purchased some $$$ pricey Mighty Leaf matcha powder $24.95 to make our own lattes and smoothies at home as well.

The staff here was extremely pleasant on our late night visit.

If in So Cal, sign up for their rewards program through i phone app or internet account.  For every 15 purchases you get a free drink!  

Aside from the rewards program, Peet's always gives a free drink credit for a small drip coffee or tea with the purchase of coffee beans. If you are not in the mood for a drip coffee or tea, the drink credit may also be used towards a purchase of any drink on their menu.  I usually always stop in to make my special custom blend of coffee beans, a mix of Decaf and Regular Mocha Java...sometimes for a treat I have them throw in a little Arabian Mocha Sunani.
--------------------
Best place around UCI to study. Also means you gotta fight for a seat but then people occupying coffee houses to sit and look at their phones is a plague that refuses to die. Also lovely baristas. ^_^
--------------------
[SERVICE: 4.5] The service here is pretty much always great. The workers always greet you when you come in or right before your order. They always seem energetic and friendly. Although sometimes it gets quite loud in here so they may not always get your order correct. Or they might miss one word and that could alter your whole drink. So just speak loud and clear and don't be afraid to ask them to repeat back your order!

[PRODUCT: 5] I love all the drinks that I have ever gotten from here. The iced matcha green tea latte and the iced earl grey latte were fabulous replacements for coffee. The iced white chocolate mocha espresso drink was fantastic as well. It is a bit pricey though (about $5 for a small) but sometime they'll have 50% coupons and my total for one drink was only $2.10 with the coupon!

[ENVIRONMENT: 5] Its a very adorable cafe with a lot of tables and chairs but it is a small space so it does get crowded and loud. A lot of people come in to study or do work so sometimes there's not always free tables or chairs.

[OVERALL: 5] The place is very clean and the service is always great. I will definitely continue to come and highly recommend to any coffee or tea lover or anyone looking for a Starbuck's replacement.
--------------------
Legit the slowest barristas ever. It's like they keep cracking jokes at each other. Going "right, right" while ambling slowly towards cash register. Just get. my. cof. fee.
--------------------
Decent place to study off campus. The day time staff are usually pretty good with regular customers and provide decent service.
--------------------
This Peet's is a great place to go if you wanna get some work done -- if you can find a table! There are always college students/professors here, so a lot of times the tables are always taken. There are also plenty of tables outside too, but there might not be an outlet nearby if you plan on camping out for a few horus. Overall, place has a very cozy feeling, and I really like it.

As for the drinks, they'realright. Nothing too special. I usually just go for the caramel macchiato because I love me some caramel. The iced teas are pretty good too, but make sure to ask for light ice. If not, you'll end up with 90% ice and 10% drink. 

The staff here is friendly and helpful, no complaints here!
--------------------
I was here with my boyfriend and I caved and ordered a drink from Peet's Coffee since it was so hot. I've honestly never been inside a Peet's before in my life, let alone ever ordered anything from one, but I decided to order one of their Javiva Blended drinks in the Matcha Green Tea flavor! Surprisingly I really liked it! It was so good and I'm happy I finally tried this place out, especially since I've been going to UCI for almost four years and have never step foot in it even though it's at the UTC plaza. At least now I know how good their Javiva Blended drinks are and if I'm ever craving something cold and sweet on a hot day I know I can always go back and get something from Peet's!
--------------------
After I was helping my friend out on his college club, I went here to chill and enjoy myself. It was cool they have a quick system to get all orders. They have their own business stickers that you could have to keep. I wish there were more seats, so everyone could do computer work and enjoy being with someone. Other than that, just be yourself and enjoy to order what you want.
--------------------
I didn't know what to expect when I came here. I do frequent other, more mainstream, coffee places like Starbucks or The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf so Peet's never crossed my mind as a coffee place that I'd ever visit. However, I really liked it!

I arrived in the morning to wait for my girlfriend to get out of class. I took the time to look through the menu and other recommendations on Yelp, and I saw the Iced Caramel Macchiato. I don't usually order strong-coffee-flavored drinks but I took a leap of faith. What I got was a sweet-tasting cold coffee that brightened up my morning.

I felt like a person who actually drinks coffee in the morning, and not a basic white girl that takes Instagram pictures of her coffee, no offense to them. I spent the rest of my time charging my phone and writing reviews (since I was a little backed up).
--------------------
Peet's coffee has quickly become one of my family's favorite gormet coffee shops.  The experience at the Peet's near UC Irvine certainly exemplifies why.  The crew in this shop are friendly, quick at the bar and attentive to allergies.  The barista Daisy is superb in her memory of repeat customers and making sure each drink has that unique Peet's aroma without the burnt finish sometimes experienced with espresso beverages.  If you are just looking for a great local coffee shop or seeking a cut above the norm, I would recommend checking out this Campus Peet's coffee shop.
--------------------
A Black forest ham sandwich cost $6.95. Ham, cheese and lettuce cold sandwich pretty much. Smells a hint of trash.. literally. I dont think think its from the cheese. 
I would drink coffee but never eating sandwich from here again

Pretty good for a in-school Wendy's was not expecting it. Very quick and fresh food I've had multiple items from the menu and everything tastes hot and fresh. Probably one down side is the drink options but it doesn't take away from the value it has to offer.
--------------------
Sometimes, you just need to give in to the voice in the back of your mind that says, "today is cheat day." 

Wendy's is just another fast food place at UCI amidst the other gazillion food places in this food court. There's something here that the other places don't have though. Mo - fuggin - CHOCOLATE - FROSTY.

Treat yoself.
--------------------
So full for a $4 meal. This time was my first time at a Wendy's and I must say that the prices are amazing. 

I picked the $4 meal (their new meal deal) this comes with a drink, 4 pc nuggets, burger and fries. What a great deal for a college student! 

The cashier was very helpful and nice when he took my order. However, expect long line from 11 AM-1 PM.
--------------------
Wendy's is simply a fast food restaurant you would go to when you're a broke college student.

Lots of folks get the 4 for 4$. I don't. I don't drink soda. Everything is 1$ each anyway.

Fries taste okay. Not the best. The 1$ chicken sandwich is actually pretty tasty, similar to a mcchicken but not as good. The nuggets here are great and come in both regular or spicy. I got an asian cashew salad before and although it's expensive I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Don't get me started on the 1$ vanilla soft serve.

Yelp 2014 Challenge #22/100
They have really nice service at the location. They work with so much diligence, and one of the workers there calls you "boss", making you feel like you're in control. They have a pretty good fish sandwich (but then I again, I love fish haha- doesn't completely compare to McDonald's, but college student with no car gotta get his fish sammiches somewhere!) They have a dollar value menu that is really good for people who don't really want to spend much on food.
--------------------
I'd say this Wendy's is one step up from a regular Wendy's.  Quick Service especially during lunch hours.  Cheapest food on campus and is generally of always the same quality.  Only thing i don't like is the honey mustard here... tastes like plastic.  Also, it's weird that spicy chicken nuggets are 20 cents cheaper than regular chicken nuggets.

The guy in a blue shirt with a shaved head is probably the coolest guy ever too.  Always really friendly.  
PS: Lettuce wrapped is available upon request
PPS: Most years they have a $1 wendy's keychain that entitles you to a free jr frosty with any purchase... Being A UCI student, it really goes a long way!
--------------------
Eh, Foods honestly what ever here. Had breakfast here this morning, and the egg and tortilla was still cold from being in the fridge in my Egg Sausage burrito. Their food quality has gone down hill the four years I been at UCI.

Everything is getting so small, I guess its matching the demographic coming into UCI with the proportions they eat. I guess it either forces you to eat less, or buy more... lol.
--------------------
THE WORST COSTOMER SERVICE EVER!! I ordered my food, waited more than 20 min, still didnt get my food! The waitress (OLD LADY) gave me strong atiitude. I didnt pay for that attitude, ok?
--------------------
Of all the places at UCI's West Food Court, this is the place I frequented the most.
Honestly, if I needed a quick bite to eat before class or didn't want to spend too much money, this was my go-to place!
Not really going to write about the food, but I'll leave some tips!

Pro-Tips :]
- They currently offer a deal where if you buy their tag, any future purchases come with a free small frosty :D If you're going to attempt to share tags, don't let them see you do it,, otherwise they won't let you use it. They are pretty strict about that.
- If you're looking for the quickest bite to eat due to class and such, this is probably the place!
- Spicy Chicken Nuggets (cheaper than regular, what????) go super well when you dip it in a frosty (I prefer Chocolate)
- The Value Menu is lovely for college students!
- Easiest place to stack up on Napkins!!
- Always ask for your favorite sauces!
- BE NICE TO THE STAFF.
--------------------
Not the best spicy chicken sandwich unfortunately. I can tell that these aren't fresh and have been out for awhile. The location is good for the campus and the food is cheap and can be made fast. Some of the prices are cheaper than other locations. It's an okay place got lunch.
--------------------
Cheap burgers, nuggets, and fries. Satisfies just about any college student's needs for lunch or any meal for that matter. You can easily get full for about under 5 bucks for a REALLY BIG MEAL or even just 2 bucks can have you set until dinner time. 5 piece spicy chicken nuggets are probably the most ordered thing on this menu because for $1, you can't really beat that price. Conveniently located and open late. This is the only reason why people still study at the food court. If this place closed, everyone would probably migrate and overflood gateway and other study places closeby.
--------------------
Slightly better than your average Wendy's. Since its in Irvine, they seem to abide by the general rules better than all the others. The guy with the Hispanic guy with the buzzed hair (who is probably the manager) is very nice.
--------------------
what can i say about my homegirl, wendy?...we entered into this relationship when i was first introduced to her my freshman year at UCI and she's been faithful ever since. i guess we're more like friends with benefits but she's the only one in the whole food court that conveniently caters to my needs whether it's being there for me early in the morning or at random hours during the weekend. she's all about cheap and fast food and im a poor college student in a hurry so our relationship works out pretty well. don't trip though, im not the jealous type so theres lots of her redhead goodness go around.

oh yeah, and make sure you get ahold of one of her frosty tags so you get a free frosty with every purchase...even if you just buy one thing off the dollar menu!
--------------------
I go here simply because it is convenient that it is on campus. But I am sick and tired of them messing up my order all the time.  4 times to be exact.  Unlike all the other food places on campus, Wendy's likes to hire non-student, non-English speaking, druggy workers.  The first time they got my order wrong, I politely told them I actually ordered a #7. Instead of being sorry or correcting her mistake, she straight up argued with me saying "NO you order #10".... 7 and 10 don't even sound the same! Maybe I should've said SIETE.  She ended up just completely refusing to do anything about it.  2nd time it was a matter of the person not understanding English again. The third time the guy just seem high and didn't listen.  The forth time he gave me spicy chicken instead of the regular ones (which I paid 20cents more and still didn't get).
